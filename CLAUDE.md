## Rules for Claude (Always Follow)

### CLAUDE.md Management
- Always read this file at the start of every session.
- Update the Session Log at the end of every session with completed tasks and fixes.

### GitHub Safety
- Always commit the current working code before starting edits.
- If a change may break existing functionality, create a new branch and explain why.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages for all changes.

### Preserve Functionality
- Do not remove or alter working features unless explicitly instructed.
- If a change risks regression, stop and explain the impact before proceeding.

### Code Changes
- Keep changes incremental and well-commented.
- Highlight what was added, removed, or updated.

### Verification
- After edits, run tests or basic checks to confirm nothing is broken.
- Report any errors, warnings, or issues that appear.

### General
- Treat GitHub as the single source of truth.
- All steps must be safe, reversible, and transparent.
