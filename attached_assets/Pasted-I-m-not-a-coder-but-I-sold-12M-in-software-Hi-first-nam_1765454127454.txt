I’m not a coder… but I sold $12M+ in software  Hi {first_name},

If you'd have told me 10 years ago that I'd sell over $12 MILLION of "software" online in my spare time, I'd have LAUGHED at you... 

See, even though I've been selling online for well over 23 years now... As a NON-TECHNICAL, NON-CODER in many different business models...  I always assumed building and selling SOFTWARE would be impossible for me...

That was until one day, a guy I knew online who had almost ZERO experience, and ZERO previous success ended up making his OWN chrome extension...

He wasn't a CODER.

He wasn't GEEKY.

He wasn't TECHNICAL.

At all.

He just HIRED somebody on UPWORK to build it for him...

And I was partially SHOCKED and partially IMPRESSED that he'd have the BALLS to do it...  And the thing is, it WORKED!

AND he made MONEY with it!

GOOD money...

I'd literally been selling online for almost TWO DECADES at that point in so many different business models and I truly thought that THAT one, was one of the ones I wouldn't be able to do...

Until I did.

Just like when I first ever went skiing, I got STUCK on a mountain.

I'd just watched my friends girlfriend go HEAD FIRST down the part of the mountain we were stuck on... 

...and it was only her FACE and the TREE that stopped her!

I was nervous...

Nervous that I'd go HEAD FIRST down the mountain too leaving my FATE to LUCK...

I was there for 5 minutes, wondering what to do next... The SLOPE was STEEP and ICEY and I didn't have the SKILLS or experience to make it...

Then, about 10 TINY little children in a KIDDY SKI SCHOOL...
 Came FLYING DOWN the hill in PERFECT synchronization!

WEAVING in and out, super fast and going almost STRAIGHT DOWN...

And here was me... SCARED of even going ACROSS it, one step at a time...

So the next minute I thought to myself...

If THEY can do it, I can do it...

And SEEING those little kids so ELEGANTLY skiing, FEARLESSLY at such a young age gave me the COURAGE to just GO FOR IT...  So, I pushed off with my SKIS and I MADE IT in one piece...  No INJURIES & no falls... I was IMPRESSED with myself...  THIS IS A METAPHOR I carry through with me now in LIFE...  Sometimes, things FEEL like you can't do it... 

Maybe they even feel SCARY, but SOMETIMES you just have to take a LEAP of FAITH and GO FOR IT!

Anyways...  Just like getting the BALLS to go down the slope...

I got the BALLS to build some software...  MILLIONS of dollars later...   I now show OTHER people how to build simple online software businesses, from scratch... with ZERO code and NO technical ability that have the potential to make $10K+ per month, with VERY little work once they are set up.  (...I do LESS than 3 hours work per MONTH on my software businesses and I make $100K+ per month doing it!)

...And they cost VERY little to build. 

What used to cost $300K+ and 3 years, can now be built in a few short weeks or months, using AI.  And if that sounds crazy... I have a FREE software building tool that you can use right now that actually builds software FOR you, right in front of your eyes... 

In less than 12 minutes.

Check it out here https://blueprint.mattwebley.com/

...Make sure you select the BASIC PRD on that page, it just asks 6 questions and that's all you need!  Literally about 12 minutes from now you will have a FULLY WORKING SOFTWARE PROTOTYPE, that will PROVE to you that YOU can build software too!

I'm going to be sending you more cool free stuff in the next few days...

Do me a favor please...  HIT REPLY to this email and let me know you got it please (I read all the replies to these emails)...  Until next time {first_name},

Matt Webley

I was building the WRONG business for years 
Hi {first_name},

I started out BROKE...

I had ZERO money growing up...  My parents were unemployed for most of my childhood until my dad became a taxi driver in my teens...  "No, you can't have that, we can't afford it"

"No, we can't go there, we can't afford it"...

These are the words I got used to hearing growing up...  Until I just stopped asking...

BUT...  Those words are the SAME words that put a FIRE in my belly to try and GET RICH...

I didn't know HOW, but I know I HAD to...

When I told my my first girlfriend I'd get RICH someday she said...  "Look at you Matt, you're NOTHING... You're a NOBODY... You'll never do ANYTHING with your life"

And my family told me...  "The rich stay rich, and the poor stay poor"...

Anyways...  I KNOW what it's like to have NOTHING...  And luckily, I was able to BREAK the chains of "benefits" when I started making MONEY online...  BUT get this...  I bounced around ONE business model to another...

And whilst I made GOOD money online... Something was always missing.

I made my first $100K in affiliate marketing...  Then I made my first $ million in online courses...

Then I made another $10 million...

But I wasn't FULFILLED... I didn't ENJOY what I was doing... 

And it didn't feel like I was really building anything OF VALUE...

Even though I was making GOOD MONEY... and I achieved my DREAMS and then some...   Nothing I was doing really made me feel like I was on the right path...  So I distracted myself with NONSENSE, TIME WASTING and I even bought a NIGHTCLUB at one point...   But the feeling remained...  Selling LOW TICKET courses and BEER to DRUNKS wasn't really what I thought my life would be about...

So I started building an AMAZON business...  And that felt the same...  I was just BUYING LOW and SELLING high but feeling every day like I was CAPABLE OF MORE...

Like this wasn't ALL my life should be about...  It was ONE bad business model after another...  They felt TEMPORARY...  VALUELESS almost...  Then I discovered SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE...

It was the TOTAL opposite...  It was FACELESS...  PASSIVE...  STICKY (as in, people would pay EVERY MONTH because they GENUINELY got VALUE from the product - which was a FIRST for me)...  See, if they don't like the software, they JUST CANCEL...  So when you have customers staying for YEARS then you KNOW that you're getting something right!

I looked back at all the businesses I'd started and then stopped... Never STICKING to anything...  And wishing I'd have found SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE earlier...  Now, just a few short years ago, I WOULD have said...  DO NOT GET INTO SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE...

It's EXPENSIVE to build ($250K+)...  VERY slow to build (2-3 years)...  And it's VERY hard, with HIGH TECHNICAL barriers to entry that you have to HIRE coders for...  ...And you have NO IDEA if it's even going to make money UNTIL you've spent YEARS and all that MONEY and TROUBLE building it!  But here's the thing...  Recently, AI and AI agents changed EVERYTHING!

Now, ANYBODY can build a SAAS business...  But soooooooo few people even KNOW about it...  Which means there's a MASSIVE opportunity for YOU...  If you're interested in watching a FREE training you can watch a course I made a while back (it's 100% FREE and actually pretty good - for free anyway)...  Here's the link https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBWe6vcnwg2GEmK_AwLVkLhA76epp-MM  If you watch that, you'll see how EASY it is to build something from scratch using AI and NO code whatsoever...  OR...

You can BOOK A CALL with me... 

https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt
 (...I offer 1:1 mentorships where I help you build, launch and scale your business WITH you... click by click, step by step.  ...it's the FASTEST and EASIEST way to get up and running and build a passive income of $5-$10K+ per month in my opinion...   ...in probably the BEST business model right now)

And the beauty of it is, is if you get it to $10K per month, you can probably SELL the business for anywhere from $250-$600K ish on sites like EMPIRE FLIPPERS)

Anyway, watch out for tomorrow's email... I'm going to tell you why MOST people FAIL at online business and how YOU can increase your chances of success by 500%+...  Until tomorrow,

Matt Webley

-----

Why most people FAIL at online business (and don’t even know it)

Look {first_name}...

Here's the TRUTH...

You're probably one of these TWO types of people...

You've either NEVER tried to build an online business before...

Or...

2. You've TRIED to build an online business but it didn't work out QUITE as you'd hoped...  Look, I've been there...

Not EVERY business I ever built worked out...  But here's the thing... 

As much as I've had a few DUDS... 

I've had WAAAAAY more successes than your average Joe...

I'm not saying that to brag. 

It's just true.

And anybody that's followed me at any point over the 23+ years I've been in business will have SEEN me do exactly what I'm telling you... 

Time and again.

Start something from scratch. Make it work. Pivot. 

Start something else from scratch. Make it work. Pivot again.

In fact, my SUCCESS rate of taking an idea and turning it into a business with little to NO up-front investment from ZERO to $100K+ per year PROFIT is SCARILY good...

They always say the FIRST $100K is HARDER than the first MILLION...

Well, I'm REALLY good at that first $100K part.

Because I came from NOTHING... 

I had NO MONEY and NO ADVANTAGES I had to figure it all out for myself...

So I KNOW where you're at...

You don't have MILLIONS in the bank...

You don't have HIGH LEVEL connections that you can LEAN on for guidance...

You don't have BANK OF MONEY OR DADDY to give you a head start...

You're just a NORMAL everyday person, like me... 

That wants more from life.

And you KNOW that nobody is going to just come along and GIVE it to you...

YOU have to FIND an opportunity and MAKE IT WORK...

Because if you don't, the alternative is MORE years of your life being JUST THE SAME AS IT IS RIGHT NOW...

And you want more... (and that's OK).

If you didn't want your LIFE to be filled with more... 

You wouldn't be reading this right now...

Here's the thing...

For MOST people it seems $5-$10K per month is the HOLY GRAIL... 

The amount that would be LIFE changing for them.

That would allow them to QUIT their jobs and do more of what they want to do with their life... 

And frankly, without meaning to sound like an ASSHOLE...

$10K+ per month, in the RIGHT business model is EXTREMELY achievable...

Especially now AI has changed everything and lowered the barriers to entry to almost ANYBODY (if you know what you are doing with it).

Maybe you need to HEAR this next part...

EVERYTHING you have TRIED before that didn't work out... DOES NOT DEFINE you... 

You are NOT your past... Whilst yes, it's SHAPED you, it's NOT who you are...

You CANNOT be a FAILURE if you never give up... and you only need to SUCCEED ONCE to become the WINNER you know deep down YOU CAN BE...

Look...

ANYBODY will fail with the WRONG system...

The WRONG business model...

The WRONG guidance...

But just because what you tried out before NEVER worked... doesn't mean NOTHING EVER CAN...

I've tried DOZENS of business models... 

Quit most of them...

They are NOT ALL BUILT EQUALLY...

AI SAAS is NEW... and it's DIFFERENT... 

The AI means NOW, ANYBODY can succeed in ways that were never possible before...

Tomorrow, I'm going to tell you the SECRET character trait you MUST have to be successful... 

Without it, YOU *WILL* FAIL!

Until then,

Matt Webley

P.S. If you want help building your own AI SAAS business from scratch, even if you have NO IDEA what to build or how to build it, then BOOK A CALL with me here https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt

P.P.S. Trying to "figure stuff out" on your own usually = ZERO results for MOST people. If you've never had a GENUINE 1:1 mentor, that's been there and done it then you probably don't realize the simple tweaks that you can make to CHANGE EVERYTHING. There's not a single "guru" online that doesn't suggest FINDING yourself a mentor, but they very rarely tell you HOW... Book a call and see if you qualify for my mentorship, it could change EVERYTHING for you.






The ONE thing you MUST have to be successful...

Hi {first_name},

Everybody told me I'd be a BUM.

My works mates.

My girlfriend.

My teachers.

NOBODY believed in me.

BUT here's the thing...

I felt SORRY for them...

Because I KNEW that not only would I make some money...

I'd GET RICH some day...

Now, if you STRUGGLE with the idea of being "rich" and you're good with $10K passive per month... 

...that's a GREAT START!

I remember telling my college lecturer that earning JUST £50 (about $70 US) per week would be LIFE CHANGING for me...

And at the time it would have been...

He LAUGHED at me and told me to set my expectations higher...

He had a small online business doing about $10K per YEAR on the side selling millennium bug "fix" tools lol...

See, here's the thing...

I KNEW I'd get rich... but I didn't know HOW...

And now, looking back, it was NEVER the HOW that resulted in me making MILLIONS...

I'd have done it in ANY wealth building vehicle...

It was this ONE trait that I had... in SPADES...

It was BELIEF.

I BELIEVED to my CORE that it was possible.

And not only that it was POSSIBLE, it was INEVITABLE...

I was DELUSIONAL...

Genuinely...

And if you'd have met me back then you'd have said I was IMMATURE, CLUELESS, DIRECTIONLESS...

But just this BALL of SELF BELIEF...

Now, you're reading this right now... And maybe you're thinking...

You don't HAVE the belief in yourself...

Maybe you don't even believe it's possible AT ALL...

Maybe you don't believe it's possible FOR YOU...

But here's the thing...

AI has changed EVERYTHING....

With AI now doing ALL everything FOR YOU that you could never do before...

In the case of AI SAAS...

It helps you RESEARCH the market.

It helps you come up with an IDEA and a UNIQUE SELLING point.

It PLANS your SAAS for you.

It DESIGNED your SAAS for you.

It BUILDS & CODES your SAAS for you.

It writes the SALES COPY to give away FREE TRIALS of your SAAS for you.

It helps you MARKET your SAAS.
So now, when AI is doing everything at the HIGHEST levels possible... 

...and ALL you need to do it TELL IT WHAT TO DO and it DOES it...

Why can't it NOW work for YOU?!

The TRUTH is...

You don't know what you don't know...

If you did... You'd have a LIGHTBULB moment and realize that EVERYTHING you tried before that didn't work for you, COULD now work for you...

BECAUSE of AI...

If you want help WALKING through how to build an AI SAAS business from scratch to generate a faceless, single person, AI income stream of $5-$10K+ per month within the next 6-12 months... 

BOOK A CALL https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt

This call COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!

Until tomorrow,

The truth about AI everyone’s missing…

Hi {first_name},

In 2024, one of my HUMAN coders that builds software for me said to me "AI will never take my job, it's stupid, I'm safe"...

And whilst at the time, it felt like AI coders were a long way off... 

FAST FORWARD TO NOW...

I'd say AI can create software, FASTER, EASIER, CHEAPER and most importantly... 

BETTER...

Than 95%+ of HUMAN coders... even the ones that have been at it DECADES...

He couldn't have been more wrong.

Then, more recently... 

I went to a business event and on stage a "guru" told the audience to "treat ChatGPT like a 20K a year intern"...

Lol... Made me laugh...

CLUELESS. 

HEAD BURIED IN THE SAND.

Like most "guru's".

Look... 

I'm not saying ChatGPT is the HOLY GRAIL of LLM's...

...but it ASTOUNDS me how so many "guru's" don't get the GRAVITY of what is happening in the AI space right now...

Here's the TRUTH...

AI is going to TAKE most people's jobs... And over time, MOST peoples businesses.

There I said it...

Now... I'm to WISHING for this...

I don't even WANT that...

There will be WAAAAAY more losers than there are winners in that equation...

And I fear we'll ultimately be "victims" of whatever leadership we have in place at the time...

Will they TAX the AI companies and distribute it to the people to give everybody a better life?!

Maybe... But based on past performance of many WESTERN GOVERNMENTS... 

I doubt it...

I HOPE that takes a VERY long time for the AI human displacement to happen... 

I truly hope it's not in the next 10 years...

But here's the thing...

You can WAIT to see what happens...

HEAD buried in the sand and HOPE THE EVIL AI ZOMBIES don't come for YOU and YOUR livelihood...

OR...

You can RIDE the WAVE of AI... look to MAKE AS MUCH money as humanly possible, AS QUICKLY as possible... 

And look to put yourself in the HAVES and not the HAVE NOTS...

...since you can FLIP profitable SAAS companies for up to 60x monthly revenue, getting a SAAS business to $20K per month could mean you SELL it on a site like EMPIRE FLIPPERS for $1.2 million... 

ANYBODY would agree that for MOST people, that's LIFE CHANGING money...

AI will come for ALL jobs and small businesses that governments and societies don't INSIST must be human...

So do you GAMBLE on how long you have left to STACK CASH, ASSETS and get SECURITY for the future?

Or do you GRAB THIS BITCH by the HORNS and RIDE it into the SUNSET...

I know what I'm doing...

If you’re chasing the perfect idea... stop.

Hi {first_name},

One of the BIGGEST problems my clients face BEFORE coming to me is this...

Coming up with the PERFECT AI SAAS idea.

Look, the truth is, there IS now perfect idea.

There are SOME ideas better than others...

For example...
If you are GOOD at something and you have KNOWLEDGE, EXPERTISE or EXPERIENCE in it...

And you can somehow TIE THAT into the SAAS that you build...

The YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE in that space...

Same with if you have a niche AUDIENCE, CUSTOMER BASE or COMMUNITY in that space... AMAZING!

...even if you just have some MILD INTEREST in the space, that HELPS!

BUT...

If you don't THAT'S OK!

I advise you find a SMALL B2B (business to business) MICRO NICHE with competitors ALREADY selling something similar...

...and you CLONE the core feature set of those competitors and then ADD one or two UNIQUE features on top.

BOOOOOOM!

TRUST me, this is GOLD.

If there's already 3-5 competitors in the space SELLING something similar, that means there are DEV teams (coders) that are FEEDING their families based off THAT customer base!

So, if you come into the market, FAST using AI... 

You can be competitor number 6 and TAKE some of their customers!

If this sounds harsh, then don't be hurt...
 It's the GAME... and when YOU are number 1, somebody will come and try and take yours too!

The bottom line is this...

There IS no perfect niche... The PERFECT niche should be replaced with the "PROGRESS" niche...

PICK a niche... and make PROGRESS by MOVING FORWARDS!

Now, I DO have a bunch of exercises in my training to help people come up with THEIR niche and I walk my mentorship clients through it STEP-BY-STEP...

I've not had ONE client ever NOT be able to come up with a GOOD idea so far...

If you want help coming up with an idea for your own SAAS business Book a call https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt I can help you build out your entire AI SAAS business from scratch...

Hope this helps...

{first_name}, I only have one spot left...


Hi {first_name},

Every month I ONLY open 3 NEW spaces to my 1:1 mentorship program...

It's a HARD cap.

I do this because it is very TIME INTENSIVE and ENERGY intensive on me to do genuine 1:1 mentorship... 

If I was selling a course, I'd take on however many, it wouldn't matter...

But this is ME and YOU working together on building you an AI SAAS business from scratch...

Weekly 1:1 calls...

I couldn't handle 50 people (and wouldn't want to) because what matters is ONLY working with people who I can help, and doing EVERYTHING in my power to get them RESULTS!

I usually have a WAITING list so I do not always even HAVE call slots available... 

I recently opened up some slots and have almost filled them for my next intake... I have ONE SPOT LEFT...

It's FIRST come, FIRST served...

As soon as it's filled anybody else will go on the waiting list OR I'll close my call slots altogether. 

Do you want the slot {first_name}?

If so, apply now at this link...

https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt

It's a casual chat and I'll be HONEST, I'll only invite you if I can genuinely help you...

I look forward to speaking to you soon...  Matt Webley

{first_name}...

Are you still looking to start a business with AI?

Matt

-------

{first_name}, I've filled my slots for this month now BUT...

As I mentioned before... 

I only take on 3 NEW mentees per month to help them build an AI SAAS business...

And I have filled them for this month now...

Here's the thing...

I usually open MORE call slots than I need to because I don't usually accept MOST people to my mentorship....

It often runs at 70-80% application rejection...

BUT...

This time, I have filled my mentee slots more quickly than expected...

(...good bunch of new peeps)

So anyways...

Long story short... INSTEAD of closing the remaining slots this month... 

I'm going to LEAVE my CURRENT FREE call slots OPEN...

AVAILABLE for more calls (even if we wait for next month to onboard people) which means... 

*WAITING LIST IS INCOMING...*

This could mean being locked out for MONTHS as I onboard the waiting list FIRST...

So... if you want to start your own AI SAAS business SOON...

(...and time IS of the essence with this) 

...then you NEED to book a call now or risk getting LOCKED out of this for potentially MONTHS...

Here's the call link
https://www.mattwebley.com/workwithmatt

If there are no slots available, then it has filled up...

The 3-step system I use to validate any AI SaaS idea fast

Hi {first_name},

There's absolutely NO point trying to build a software as a service business if you aren't going to make any MONEY at it...
So here's my 3-step framework to make sure that you're NOT wasting your time building the WRONG thing!

STEP 1.

Ask your LLM.

You can just straight up ASK ChatGPT or Claude or whatever if your idea is likely a VIABLE idea...

Will this make money or not? And WHY?

Now here's the thing...

AI can often LIE to you... telling you what you WANT to hear...

So make sure you tell it to BE HONEST and NOT sugar coat it... (it might STILL lie).

STEP 2. 

Look for competitors SELLING something similar.

If there are other products on the market already with similar FEATURES that solves the SAME problems, then chances are you can make something BETTER, FASTER, CHEAPER and take some of their market share.

STEP 3.

ASK your target market.

If you can TALK to people that have the PROBLEM that your SAAS is looking to solve and simply see if they LIKE the idea (or if they shoot it down) then you can learn lots this way.

STEP 4. (BONUS)

TRUST YOUR GUT.

It NEVER lets me down. If your GUT says do it, DO it... If it says DON'T, then DON'T!

Often times I find having somebody to BOUNCE off is really helpful...

If you want somebody to help you FLESH out your idea, then BOOK A CALL with me...

Over $23 MILLION online in multiple niches, I usually have a GREAT gut feeling...

If you’ve ever felt written off… read this.

Hi {first_name},

Most people don't seem to understand why I get so passionate talking about the AI SAAS opportunity...

See the thing is...

I was F**King BROKE...

And it SUCKED...

NOBODY gave me a chance.

NOBODY helped me.

And EVERYBODY wrote me off as some LOSER...

I didn't HAVE much going for me, but I made the best of my situation at the time... 

And used what I DID have, and that was BELIEF.

The problem is, MOST everyday people do NOT believe in themselves.

They don't believe that THEY can get rich.

They don't even believe that they are capable of anything MORE than what they are doing right now...

And it's EASY to see why people fall into that mindset...

Because when they DO try something, it NEVER seems to work out how they'd hoped...

Or even worse, they talk themselves out of even TRYING it...

See, the difference between the AI SAAS opportunity and EVERY opportunity that has come before is that THIS one is using AI to build a REAL business but making it so that everything that WOULD have stopped you is NO LONGER STOPPING YOU...

So NORMAL people can use this vehicle to MAKE REAL MONEY.

And what I REALLY like about the AI SAAS business model is it is...

Faceless (you don't NEED to be the front man (or woman) 
Passive income once established (the customers recur every month and the software provides what they pay for, NOT you!) 
Can be built in your SPARE time (5-10 hours per week is PLENTY in most cases) 
Does NOT need a big up-front investment ( there's strategies you can use that will reduce the build cost to a few hundred dollars all in)
Ad costs are basically ZERO (I encourage my clients to use FREE marketing strategies) 
You need ZERO tech skills (no coding needed) 
And you can run to from anywhere in the world from your phone or a computer as long as you have access to the internet.

This is NOT a complete list of why this is the BEST opportunity that you'll have likely come across... There's tonnes more!

Thing is, it's NOT get rich quick either...

You can find TONNES of huge companies doing this EXACT business model... But they were built BEFORE AI...

So the opportunity is REAL... it's just been OPENED UP to ANYBODY that knows how, using AI.

I don't think this opportunity will last FOREVER...

What really does these days?!

But I DO know that RIGHT NOW...

You are EARLY...

NOT late...

And you can spend the next 1-3 years building something HUGE before anybody really understands what's going on in the AI SAAS space and the COMPETITION FLOODS in (you'll already have your market share and your loyal customers by then!)  Want help building this from A-Z including the IDEA, the BUILD, the LAUNCH, the MARKETING, the SCALING?   Everything?

Book a call... Let's see if we'd be a good fit to work together so you have your very own 8-figure SELF-MADE mentor... that knows EXACTLY what YOU need to do to get success...

Why competition is the BEST sign your idea will make money

I think one of the BIGGEST mistakes people make when trying to build SAAS businesses is thinking that the idea needs to be UNIQUE...

I think this is not only NOT true...

I think it HURTS your progress...

Do you know how many ideas are actually UNIQUE?!?

0.0000000000000001%

Honestly... EVERYTHING worth doing has pretty much ALREADY BEEN DONE...

So NOT starting your own AI SAAS business because you "can't think of a good idea" I think is frankly BS...

You not only don't NEED a unique idea, I think it HURTS you...

It's my opinion that it's MUCH better for you to go into a market with ESTABLISHED competition...

I think the SWEET spot is 2-5 (ish) competitors...

Yes, you don't want it SWAMPED with 50+ people selling similar stuff...

But 1...2...3...?

I think that's GREAT!

Because it PROVES there's a market there...

It PROVES there's SPEND there...

And it's A LOT easier to come up with a UNIQUE FEATURE idea than it is to come up with something nobody has ever thought of before...

And then we attack the niche with AI which provides MASSIVE cost savings, MASSIVELY increased SPEED of implementation and puts you in a position to DISRUPT the status quo...

Trust me... move into a MARKET using AI to build this stuff (with my PROVEN sales and marketing strategies) and you'll have the competition SCARED OF YOU...

STOP thinking you can't start an AI SAAS business because you don't have a great idea...

With maybe 50% of my clients the first 1-3 weeks of what we do together is coming up with a GREAT idea (together)... And it's VERY rarely a truly 100% unique one...

In fact, it's usually best NOT to be...

The only 2 numbers that matter in SaaS (ignore the rest)


Hi {first_name},

There's TWO numbers that REALLY matter in SAAS.

CAC (customer acquisition cost)

How much does it cost to get ONE customer.

And...

LTV (lifetime value)

How much do they pay you over time.

If you can get your CAC to be LOW and your LTV to be HIGH...

YOU MAKE BANK $$$

Here's the thing though...

I do NOT suggest to my students and mentees to start off PAYING for customers...

Yes, there's some strategies you can use with PAID traffic that are NO BRAINERS because they PRINT money...

Retargeting ads for example...

It's stupid to NOT turn them on... because they are DISGUSTINGLY profitable...

BUT...

In MOST cases, at least for the first few months, I suggest 100% free or NEARLY free organic strategies...
 And the ones I think you SHOULD use, you only usually pay for them IF they are profitable... like building an army of affiliates that you pay 10-30%ish to - but only AFTER you have the money... 

So you take 70% of it, and pay your affiliate 30%...

Some people get scared to start affiliate programs because they don't like the idea of giving away 10-30% but that's literally retarded...

YOU ONLY PAY if they send you a SALE... lol...

And YOU get to dictate what that payment percentage is...

So if this made you feel weird, TRUST me... 

Affiliate programs are NO BRAINERS... 

I've made MILLIONS with them...

So, back to CAC and LTV...

There's MORE metrics to focus on, like MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and Churn (how many people cancel every month) but lets not complicate it for now...

ALL YOU NEED TO CARE ABOUT with your AI SAAS business IS...

1. How do I PAY as little as possible to acquire as many customers as possible as fast as possible? (CAC)

And...

2. How do I get them to STAY around as long as possible and get VALUE from my product so they don't want to cancel - and keep paying me every month? (LTV)

So the answer to ONE is FREE or ALMOST free... and the answer to TWO is something we never stop optimizing for... But there's TONNES of strategies for... 

...the main one being, build a COOL software that ACTUALLY solves the problems that they face in a way that's EASIER, FASTER, BETTER or CHEAPER.

Get these two things RIGHT and you literally CANNOT lose with AI SAAS...

How I’d make $10K a month again from scratch (step by step)

Hi {first_name},

When I do my SALES CALLS for people applying for my mentorship...

...I'd say maybe 80-90% of them want to build a PASSIVE INCOME of between $5K-$10K per month...

Interestingly, my AMERICAN clients usually shoot for $10K+ and my BRITISH clients shoot for $5K+...

I don't know if that's because the BRITISH have been more BATTERED by years of struggle, high cost of living and low wages or if the Americans are more optimistic?!

No idea...

Anyways...

The TRUTH is... with a SAAS business $10K per month is NOT a huge business...

In fact, it's TINY....

Think about it... 

100 customers at $100 a month, is 10K...

200 customers at $50 a month, is 10K...

I have a calculator you can play with here... it's FREE...

https://calculator.mattwebley.com

It'll show you how many customers you need...

But the thing is, anything less than about 500 customers is TINY in the SAAS world...

I mean, REALLY tiny...

Now, I'm not saying you'll get 500 customers overnight, you almost certainly won't... 

...but the NATURE of SAAS is that the customers you get this month, STAY next month and the month after and the month after...

So whereas MOST businesses you go back to ZERO every month and you need another bunch of people to walk through the door to make any money again that month... 

It's NOT like that with AI SAAS!

If you had 100 customers last month, chances are THIS month you'll start with like 97 or something...

So it COMPOUNDS over time unlike MOST businesses (that are NOT subscription based)...

Meaning from a WEALTH and PASSIVE INCOME creation point of view...

There's FEW BETTER BUSINESS models!

Do me favor please...

HIT REPLY to this email right now and tell me how much YOU would need to make to CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

And... If you would, just mention what it is you'd do with the money?

I'm interested... I read (and usually reply) to ALL of the replies to my emails...

Anyways...

Let's get back to what I wanted to talk about...

What I would do, STEP BY STEP to make 10K per month with AI SAAS from scratch...

Pick a market that has 2-5 competitors in it serving a very specific and clear customer avatar (and identify the PROBLEMS that your software and features of the software solve for that avatar).
Analyze the competition, see what features they have and build a core list of features that I will CLONE, using AI, then come up with ONE or TWO unique feature ideas nobody has thought of.
Use my AI and AI agent stack to build out the MVP (minimum viable product) within 30-60 days depending on complexity and time commitment needed.
Build a high converting sales page to give away free trials using AI.
Hook up Stripe for payment processing and do all the nitty gritty small stuff like privacy policy pages and favicons using AI.
Start driving visibility by finding where my target market hang out and giving away free trials (that recur into paid subs) to as many of those people as possible.

That's IT!

Now, there's WAAAAY more to building a profitable AI SAAS business but getting to 10K per month, this is ALL I would do...

Optimization and scaling comes later...

Crazy thing is though, this would probably AUTO SCALE on its own at this point...

I've found MOST SAAS businesses tend to GROW on their own when they hit about 100 customers...

Want help coming up with YOUR idea and then help BUILDING and SCALING it to 5K-25K+ per month?

Proof: non-techy founders building AI software NO code in weeks not years

Hi {first_name},

Building software using AI is relatively new...

But it's come on soooooooo far, SOOOOOO quickly...

When I was first using AI to build software it would get it RIGHT first time, maybe 60% of the time...

Then another 20% on the second time...

And then maybe another 15% or so on the third time...

So it was a combination of CREATIVITY in using NATURAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE prompts to build out software with maybe 5% of the time you having to FIX stuff that was HARD to find a fix for...

You'd find the fix, but maybe it'd take an hour or two...

Slightly frustrating...

But WEIRDLY kind of a LOT of fun...

Now you MIGHT think frustratingly banging your head against a MONITOR shouting at the screen trying to get the AI to do what you want it to do does NOT sound fun... Maybe it even sounds like I'm a sicko for enjoying it...

BUT MY CLIENTS DID TOO!

Here's the thing though...

Over the months following that, the AI got better and better and our processes got more streamlined and it went from getting MOST stuff right in about 3 attempts to getting almost EVERYTHING right, EVERY time...

ONE prompt. Boooooom. Done.

Anyways... I did a couple of STUDENT interviews a while back now, this was when things were still "tough" (100x easier than using humans though)...

Watch these interviews... I think you'll see that these guys are NORMAL guys, like you, and they have built FULLY FLEDGED software, from scratch, with NO code, using AI...

And since recording these it's got WAAAAAAAAY easier (meaning it was possible for you to do it then, now it's SLAM DUNK EASY for almost ANYBODY to build)...

Here's James LINK

Here's Jack LINK

Have a watch and let me know by hitting reply...

Now it's got SOOO much easier and sooo much BETTER since they built their software... 

Do you think YOU could build some SAAS with AI?

Let me know...

And if so, what's stopping you from building a PASSIVE income stream with your own AI SAAS product?!

Thanks for reading and watching...

The AI SAAS Gold Rush is HERE (and it’s not hype)



Hi {first_name},

I've made $12M+ selling SAAS...

But it cost me $350K approx and YEARS to build SAAS tools with small teams...

Now, my students build the EXACT same level of software using AI and NO code...

100% NON technical...

The AI and AI agents designs it, builds it, hosts it... EVERYTHING.

So now the game has become about SALES and MARKETING...

Now before you think "I can't do SALES and MARKETING Matt"...

For me, that's the EASY bit...

YES, it takes works...

It's EASIER to build the software (nowadays) for SURE...

But that just means the BARRIER to entry that would have KEPT you out of the business model, is no longer there...

Now, YOU can have a STICKY, FACELESS, DIGITAL assets able to provide a REAL solution that people WANT...

And will pay you MONTH IN, MONTH OUT for...

Meaning you FIND these people. 

Give them a FREE trial of your software.

And between 15-55% of people will become customers...

And you can do this now in weeks and months, NOT YEARS...

Which means... RIGHT NOW, there's a GOLD RUSH...

People do NOT realize how much MONEY there is to be made DISRUPTING the SAAS industry using AI...

Where it's no longer the DEEPEST pockets that win...

Now SINGLE person teams (you) can compete with companies that have 800+ devs! 

MONSTERs...

See, you don't need to be #1 in the space to make LIFE changing money...

What if you just take 1% or 10% of their business...

To THEM, with their huge wage bills, they'd go bankrupt...

But with that same revenue and NO wage bill. 

YOU.

WOULD.

GET.

RICH...

So...

What are YOU waiting for?

Plan. Design. Build. Launch and SCALE your OWN AI SAAS business to either build passive, PREDICTABLE cashflow...

Or FLIP it for up to 60x monthly revenue.

I can help you build this out...

BOOK A CALL today and RIDE THIS AI GOLD RUSH before it's too late...

See you next time...

Why you don’t need funding, tech skills, or 10K followers 

Hi {first_name},

The BIGGEST reasons people don't THINK they can build online SOFTWARE companies (SAAS) is that they...

Don't have access to enough MONEY to pay people to build it 
They don't have any TECH or CODING skills or knowledge to build it themselves 
And they don't have any way to MARKET it (which is a skill set in itself)

And having sold over $23M+ online and counting...

I can tell you, in MOST cases...

...THEY WOULD BE RIGHT!

But here's the thing...

With AI, EVERYTHING has changed...

I have built many SAAS businesses from scratch now and I don't think I've managed to start ONE of them for LESS than 6-figures investment...

Typically, it's like $200-$400K (ish)...

But that was using HUMAN devs who are SLOW, DIFFICULT to work with and EXPENSIVE...

As somebody who DOES NOT know how to code, this and many other reasons stopped me getting into software for YEAAAARS...

Another one was I thought there was some big SECURITY barrier to entry that would be insurmountable... 

(I was wrong looking back).

I still meet people on occasion, here in Dubai, that talk about "raising funding"...

And honestly, for SAAS projects, that ALMOST feels outdated...

In the SAAS industry, they used to call starting your own SAAS company with whatever funds you had (and NOT raising Venture Capital)... BOOT STRAPPING.

Now, in the age of AI I almost feel like "BOOT STRAPPING" should be the DEFAULT...

Because, whilst you're building SLIDE DECKS and pimping your idea out to INVESTORS in the hopes somebody will like your idea (and you)...

SOMEBODY ALREADY BUILT YOUR IDEA...

*BY THEMSELVES*

...IN AN AFTERNOON WITH no code and AI!

I met a guy in a coffee shop in Dubai Mall called Andre...

He was building out an idea for a SAAS company that would use AI to help businesses take calls from clients...

He was an OLDER guy, with a CODING background that had been in the industry YEARS...

He was SOOOOOO excited about his idea...

And when he knew I had come from the opposite background to him (sales and marketing) but had DIRECT EXPERIENCE with AI and SAAS too... 

...his EARS PERKED UP and he started PICKING MY BRAINS...

Thing is, he didn't like what I had to say...

His IDEA was too small...

It was already being done, AT SCALE whilst he was talking about trying to prove concept so he could raise investment...

THOSE DAYS ARE GONE...

His idea was already being built out by people solving BIGGER problems and moving FASTER...

A few years before, his idea would have been GROUND BREAKING...

Now, it's something you can knock up with AI AGENTS plugging in a bunch of AI based APIs...

The WORLD has changed...

You don't START with investment now...

You START with an idea...

You don't SCALE up dev teams...

You JUST BUILD THE DAMN thing...

EVERYTHING has got FASTER...

EASIER...

CHEAPER...

No tech skills needed.

No funding.

AI and SPEED is where it's at...

So, onto the LAST thing...

10K followers...

Do you NEED an audience?
Hey, I'm NOT going to lie to you...

If you ALREADY have an audience, then it's like a CHEAT CODE...

It's almost impossible to NOT make money, and VERY fast...

Build a SAAS using AI.

Simple sales process.

Quick LAUNCH.

BOOOOOOOM...

Like taking CANDY OFF A BABY!

Literally EASY.

BUT...

Don't think that if you DON'T have an audience it's impossible...

See you can BUILD, BORROW or BUY your customers...

Build an audience. Slow but dependable. If you already have one, then you JUST need to build and launch your offer, EASY!

You can BORROW your audience, this is the one where people with no audience SHOULD start in my opinion.

I've seen this ONE strategy create MULTI-MILLIONAIRES so fast and so easy.

This is FINDING people WITH your audience and LAUNCHING to their audience.

You are ONE or TWO deals away from LIFE changing money with this strategy...

The last one is to BUY your audience. This is PAID ads which should need no explanation. 

So do you NEED an audience? Not at all...

99% of my clients don't have one.

You don't NEED anything now...

You need the RIGHT idea (which I can help you with)...

And you need SPEED of execution...

Don't sit around dreaming of investors getting up in yo sh*t...

JUST GET IT BUILT!

It's not even hard now...
