---

You are writing an email sequence for Matt Webley, creator of the 21-Day AI SaaS Challenge. The emails should sound like Matt — direct, encouraging, no fluff, practical. He talks like a mentor who's done this before and genuinely wants people to succeed. He's not salesy or hype-driven. He's the kind of guy who says "here's what we're doing today" and gets on with it.

## Voice Guidelines
- Short sentences. Conversational.
- Use "you" a lot. Talk directly to the reader.
- No corporate speak. No buzzwords.
- Occasional humour but never forced.
- Confidence without arrogance — "this works" not "I'm amazing"
- Sign off as "- Matt" or "Matt"
- Keep emails scannable — short paragraphs, line breaks, the odd bold word

## Email Sequence Structure
Write one email per day of the challenge (20 emails total — Day 0+1 combined, then Days 2-21). Each email should:
- Recap what they just did or are about to do (based on the day's training below)
- Reinforce why it matters in plain English
- Give one motivating push to keep going
- Include a CTA link to their dashboard: https://challenge.mattwebley.com/dashboard
- Be 100-200 words max. Short and punchy.
- Subject lines should be curiosity-driven or progress-driven, not clickbaity

## The Actual Training Content (seed each email from this)

### EMAIL 1: Day 0 + Day 1 (Welcome + Your First Ideas)
Day 0 covers commitment-setting. Students pick their "why" from 8 options (financial freedom, launch something, learn by doing, work from anywhere, provide for family, prove it to myself, build portfolio, escape current job). They set a 12-month income goal and write themselves an accountability promise. They learn 4 rules: Show Up Daily, Never Break the Chain, Done > Perfect, No Skipping.

Day 1 is the Idea Generator. AI generates 3 personalised SaaS ideas scored on 5 criteria: Market Demand, Skill Match, Passion Fit, Speed to MVP, and Monetisation (out of 25). Students can also enter their own ideas. They shortlist 1-5 favourites to carry forward.

Combined email angle: You've committed AND you already have real ideas. That's further than most people ever get.

### EMAIL 2: Day 2 — Validate Your Idea
Students validate their chosen idea. They get AI-generated validation insights, research 3+ competitors, and map out the key pain points their product solves. They write their "I Help" statement: "I help [SPECIFIC PERSON] solve [PAINFUL PROBLEM] so they can [DESIRED OUTCOME]." By the end they've locked in ONE idea with a clear value proposition.

Email angle: You're not just dreaming — you've done real market research. Your idea has legs.

### EMAIL 3: Day 3 — Core Features
AI analyses their idea and generates features across 3 categories: Core Features (solve the pain points), Shared Features (table stakes every competitor has), and USP Features (what makes them unique). Students select which features to include in their MVP and can add their own.

Email angle: You now know exactly what to build. No more guessing.

### EMAIL 4: Day 4 — Naming Your Product
AI generates 6 brandable names. Students pick one, check domain availability, check trademark databases (UK/US), verify social media handles across all major platforms, and register their domain.

Email angle: Your product has a name. It's real now. That domain is YOURS.

### EMAIL 5: Day 5 — Logo + Brand Identity
Students pick a brand vibe (Minimal, Bold, Playful, Professional, Tech, Elegant), choose a colour palette, and generate an AI logo. Options include AI image tools, Canva text logos, or a Fiverr designer for £5-20.

Email angle: Your product looks professional. Nobody will know you made this in a week.

### EMAIL 6: Day 6 — Tech Stack Setup
Students set up Replit (dev environment) and Claude Pro (AI coding assistant). They learn 4 prompt templates: problem-fixing, advice-seeking, how-do-I, and approach review. Optional tool: Wispr Flow for voice-to-text dictation.

Email angle: Your tools are ready. Tomorrow we start building the actual product spec.

### EMAIL 7: Day 7 — Your Product Blueprint (PRD)
Students review all their decisions from Days 1-6, fill in their customer avatar, and describe their desired look and feel. AI generates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document — executive summary, feature specs, design guidelines. They paste this into Replit and tell it to build.

Email angle: You just told AI exactly what to build. It's now building it. This is the moment it gets real.

### EMAIL 8: Day 8 — Claude Code Setup
Students connect their project to GitHub, install Claude Code in Replit, and create their CLAUDE.md file with golden rules and working guidelines. They learn START and END prompts for daily dev sessions.

Email angle: You now have a professional developer workflow. Most actual developers don't have this level of organisation.

### EMAIL 9: Day 9 — Claude Code Mastery
8 core skills: Be Specific (clear prompts), Reverse mistakes, Report errors properly, Break down big tasks, Commit before big changes, Ask for options, Vibe with it (be creative but watch scope creep), and Ask Why. Quick practice exercise included.

Email angle: These 8 skills are the difference between fighting AI and flowing with it. Master these and you can build anything.

### EMAIL 10: Day 10 — AI Brain + Build Loop
Two parts. Part A: Set up OpenAI API, add credits, get API key, describe ONE AI feature, build it with Claude Code. Part B: Learn the BUILD-TEST-FIX-REPEAT loop — the 4-step cycle they'll use 100+ times. Practice on a small task.

Email angle: Your app now has AI powers AND you know the exact loop you'll use to build everything else. This is the turning point.

### EMAIL 11: Day 11 — Brand Design
Choose primary brand colour, pick a design personality/inspiration (Spotify, Netflix, Airbnb style etc.), generate an AI design prompt, and Claude applies the brand across the entire app.

Email angle: Your app just went from "looks like a prototype" to "looks like a real product." First impressions matter.

### EMAIL 12: Day 12 — Let Users In (Auth + Admin)
Add user authentication — signup, login, logout, data isolation. Build an admin dashboard tracking: total users, new this week, active users, daily active users, main actions, revenue metrics.

Email angle: Real users can now sign up and use your app. And you can see everything they do from your admin panel.

### EMAIL 13: Day 13 — Email Integration
Set up Resend email API. Add welcome emails, notifications, password resets — whatever the app needs. Test by sending to yourself.

Email angle: Your app can now talk to your users even when they're not logged in. Welcome emails, notifications, the works.

### EMAIL 14: Day 15 — Payments (Stripe)
Create Stripe account in test mode. Build checkout flow. Test with fake card numbers. Complete payment flow end-to-end.

Email angle: Your app can accept money. Read that again. You built something people can pay for.

### EMAIL 15: Day 16 — Mobile Ready
Test on actual phone. Critical checks: loads on mobile, text readable, buttons tappable (44px+), no horizontal scroll, forms work, main feature works. Fix any issues.

Email angle: Over 60% of your users will be on their phone. Now your app works perfectly for them.

### EMAIL 16: Day 17 — Build & Test Sprint
Two tracks running together: Testing (signup flow, main feature, navigation, mobile) and Building (core features, bug fixes, UI polish). Track progress against 8-item MVP checklist: core features working, AI integrated, auth working, email setup, mobile responsive, onboarding built, admin dashboard, no major bugs.

Email angle: This is the final push. Sprint to the finish. Check off that MVP checklist.

### EMAIL 17: Day 19 — The Sales Machine
Build a marketing sales page using AI. Generate 10 powerful headlines. AI writes complete sales copy: headline, problem statement, solution overview, features/benefits, social proof, FAQ, CTAs.

Email angle: You now have a sales page that would cost £2,000+ from a copywriter. AI wrote it in minutes, based on everything you've built.

### EMAIL 18: Day 20 — Get Found (SEO)
Keyword research, on-page SEO (titles, meta descriptions, headers, alt text, Open Graph), technical SEO (sitemap, structured data, robots.txt). Submit to Google Search Console and Bing. List in directories: Product Hunt, BetaList, SaaSHub, AlternativeTo, Indie Hackers, G2, Capterra.

Email angle: Your product is now discoverable. Google knows you exist. Directory visitors can find you. The traffic starts here.

### EMAIL 19: Day 21 — Your $100K Roadmap
Set monthly income goal, choose pricing, calculate customers needed. Learn 20+ passive revenue strategies: AI blog content, competitor comparison pages, affiliate programs, Reddit/Quora, Product Hunt launch, guest posts, lead magnets, YouTube, Twitter threads, directory submissions, case studies, podcasts, webinars, email sequences, referral programs, localised landing pages.

Email angle: You did it. You built a real product from nothing in 21 days. Now here's exactly how to turn it into income.

### EMAIL 20: Post-Challenge Follow-Up
Celebrate completion. Remind them what they've accomplished: went from an idea to a live, paying, AI-powered SaaS product. Encourage them to keep building, keep marketing, keep iterating. The challenge is over but the business is just beginning.

Email angle: 21 days ago you had nothing. Now you have a product, a sales page, SEO, payment processing, and a marketing roadmap. That's not luck — that's execution.
